## Introduction
> Wordsmiths is an open-source repository built for one purpose; understanding and applying operational transformation using Python and Flask.

Operational Transformation (OT) is a system of algorithms designed to resolve conflicts between users in a real-time collaborative editing environment. The ultimate intention of Operational Transformation is to maintain and synchronise a consistent state between any number of users in a shared document in high latency environments.

The goal of this document is to extensively document the system and implement it.
